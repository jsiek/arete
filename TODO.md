[X] Add variants. (safe unions)
[X] Remove null pointers.
[X] Refactor type-check into AST methods
[X] interfaces, impls, and constraints
[ ] associated types (Devendra)
[ ] static borrow checking (Jeremy)
[ ] coercion insertion (Jeremy)
[ ] reformat code (Jeremy using PyCharm)
[ ] type annotations in code (Jeremy using PyCharm)
[ ] adding type checking descriptions to the spec
[ ] add variants to the spec
[ ] Explicit type arguments for generic functions.
[ ] Make the `as T` part of the `tag` expression optional.
[ ] debugger: command to display the stack (like backtrace in gdb)
[ ] Refactor desugar, const-eval into AST methods
[ ] More test cases for type checking failures.
[ ] generic impls
[ ] Check whether the pointer "lender" logic is still needed.
    (Would be nice to remove it to simplify things.)

# Permission Groups

Group several pointers together?


# Upgrade Permission

Idea from Sam TH:

Suppose you duplicate a pointer and take 1/2 the permission, but
latter on decide you wanted all of it. (Think `cdr`.)  The idea is to
have an operation that takes the rest of the permissions from the
origin, and raises an error if it does not obtain a total of 1.
(Which would happen if the original pointer had been duplicated
again.)

  categories:
    * IMMutable and shared
	* mutable and ISOlated
	* thread LOCAL
	* unsafe
  a category is fixed for each object at creatoin
  hierarchy: imm < iso < local < unsafe.
  
    Objects can only refer to other objects with the same or lesser
    capabilities: an immutable object can only refer to other
    immutable objects; an isolate object can refer to other isos or
    imms, and a local object can refer to imms, isos, and other local
    objects.

for parameters, local variables, pattern variables
need to say 
* how much priviledge: read, write
* how long: temporary, forever

alternative: what does return mean for pointers?
Do we need an annotation on functions to declare read/write or share/take?

Does return create a copy of the pointer?
If so, when is the copy killed?
Should interp_exp also return a boolean that says whether the result
is a temporary object. And the caller can kill the result after it is used?
Or should we pass the destination to interp_exp?

Or should interp_exp always create a copy, a temporary, and
the caller should always kill the result after using it?

some expressions create a temporary pointer:
* new 10
other expressions don't
* y

How to handle difference between

	{
	  var x = take new 10;
	}

which should not copy the pointer, 
and delete the pointer when x goes out of scope

versus

	{
	  var y = take new 10;
	  {
		var x = share y;
	  }
	  y := 0;
	  return y;
	}

which should copy the pointer, changing y to read only,
and then changing y back to write when x goes out of
scope.

  categories:
    * IMMutable and shared
	* mutable and ISOlated
	* thread LOCAL
	* unsafe
  a category is fixed for each object at creatoin
  hierarchy: imm < iso < local < unsafe.
  
    Objects can only refer to other objects with the same or lesser
    capabilities: an immutable object can only refer to other
    immutable objects; an isolate object can refer to other isos or
    imms, and a local object can refer to imms, isos, and other local
    objects.
